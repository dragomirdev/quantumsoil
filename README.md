# Quantum Soil Solution

Quantum Soil Solution is an Artificial Intelligence solution that predicts Soil Organic Matter (SOM) using visible and near-infrared spectroscopy.

SOM is a key indicator of soil fertility and its quality which will help in decision making process for scientific fertilisation of agricultural land.

# Why

Why is this project important?

Every second, one acre of soil becomes desert - UNCCD

Average Organic Content in the Soil is:

Northern Europe - 1.48%

Southern Europe - 1.2%

Africa          - 0.3%

India           - 0.68%

USA             - 1.25%

We need minimum 3% of organic content in Soil in order to allow it to produce sustainable food in the future.

The project will allow faster processing of SOM data and thus identify areas of land that need fertilisation earlier giving farmers an opportunity to produce food in a more sustainable way and maintain profitable income for long periods of time.

This will also benefit governments to keep investing in agricultural land with sustainable future growth.
